# ItemSwapper

> This mod is still in development and may not work as intended. Please report any issues you encounter. Also requiring a lot of help with the built in item mappings. Feel free to open a PR with your additions.

Tweaks to the inventory system based on [Xisumavoid's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6DvnFCW5FY).
Adds an item switch interface triggered by pressing a hotkey(Default: `R`). Depending on the item in the main hand, the interface will show different options(or not show up at all for unmapped items). Switch between the options by moving the mouse(or using the scroll wheel for the list). Releasing the hotkey will swap the item in the main hand with the selected item. In the item wheel, pressing the middle mouse button will toggle to a second page with more options(if available).

## Features

- Switch between items from the inventory
- Switch between items from shulker boxes in the inventory(requires the mod on the server)
- Item wheel for block pallets
- Item list for dynamic items like tools, food, potions, etc.
- Fully customizable via resource packs
- Compatible with vanilla servers(only the inventory switching feature, may trigger anti-cheat)

## Dependencies

- FabricAPI
